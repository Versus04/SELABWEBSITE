# 🏥 Healthcare Symptom Checker Chatbot

## 📋 Description
A Flask-based web application that uses machine learning to help users identify potential health conditions based on their symptoms. The application implements a decision tree classifier to predict diseases from user-input symptoms and provides relevant precautions and severity assessments.

## ⭐ Features
- 🤖 Interactive symptom-based disease prediction
- 📊 Symptom severity assessment
- 💊 Disease precautions and descriptions
- 📝 User symptom and disease history tracking
- 📈 Model accuracy reporting
- 💾 SQLite database for persistent storage
- 📋 Comprehensive logging system

## 🔧 Prerequisites
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🌶️ Flask
- 🐼 pandas
- 🧮 scikit-learn
- 📊 numpy
- 🗄️ SQLite3

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd healthcare-chatbot
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install flask pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

3. Ensure you have the following data files in their respective directories:

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### 🔍 Symptoms Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE symptoms (
    name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    severity INTEGER,
    description TEXT
)
```

### 🏥 Diseases Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE diseases (
    name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    precautions TEXT
)
```

### 📝 User History Tables
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_symptom_history (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    symptom TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)

CREATE TABLE user_disease_history (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    disease TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### 📥 GET Endpoints
- `/`: Home page
- `/get_symptoms`: Returns list of all possible symptoms
- `/get_all_symptoms`: Returns all symptoms from the database
- `/model_accuracy`: Returns the current model accuracy
- `/history`: Displays user symptom and disease history

### 📤 POST Endpoints
- `/get_next_symptom`: Processes current symptoms and returns either:
  - Next symptom to check
  - Disease prediction with description and precautions

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
- 🌳 Uses Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn
- 📚 Trained on symptom-disease dataset
- ✨ Features include various symptoms as binary indicators
- 🎯 Target variable is the disease prognosis
- 📊 Model accuracy is tracked and available via API endpoint

## 🔑 Key Functions

### 💾 Data Management
- `get_db_connection()`: Establishes SQLite database connection
- `create_tables()`: Initializes database schema
- `load_symptom_data()`: Loads symptom and disease data from CSV files

### 🔮 Prediction System
- `get_related_symptoms()`: Finds symptoms related to input symptom
- `tree_to_code()`: Converts decision tree to executable code
- `get_predicted_disease()`: Predicts disease based on input symptoms

### 🐛 Debug Functions
- `debug_data_loading()`: Validates data loading process
- `check_database_contents()`: Verifies database contents

## 🚀 Running the Application

1. Start the server:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Access the application:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## 📝 Logging
The application uses Python's built-in logging module with INFO level logging. Logs include:
- 🚀 Server start-up information
- 📊 Model accuracy metrics
- 🗄️ Database operations (when in debug mode)

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- 🛡️ SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- ✅ Input validation for symptom data
- 🔐 Error handling for file operations and database connections

## ⚡ Performance
- 📈 The model achieves approximately 98% accuracy (adjusted)
- ⚡ Symptoms are processed in real-time
- 🚀 Database operations are optimized with proper indexing

## 🔮 Future Improvements
1. 🔐 Implementation of user authentication system
2. 🤖 Addition of more sophisticated ML models
3. 🔄 Integration with external medical databases
4. 📱 Mobile application development
5. 🌍 Multi-language support
6. 📊 Enhanced visualization of symptom-disease relationships
